# Senior-Seminar-Burroughs
Optimization of a senior seminar based on choices provided

This will sort the students into five different classes based on their choices. It will prioritize first choices, and attempt to add each class to the soonest possible time frame. If it cannot add the class to the soonest possible time frame it will try the next one until it finds a place it can add it or it cannot add the class at any time. The time frames will be organized in a 2d array since there are 5 time frames, and 5 classes per time frame.
